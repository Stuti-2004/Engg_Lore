# Engineering Lore Digital Page! ðŸ“–

Welcome to Engineering Lore, the one and only (completely unauthorized) satirical news outlet dedicated to capturing the chaotic, caffeine-fueled, and sleep-deprived reality of engineering students. Whether youâ€™re here to procrastinate, laugh at the absurdity of your degree, or simply seek validation for your sufferingâ€”youâ€™ve come to the right place.
