      <strong>Engineering Lore</strong> is a satirical newspaper dedicated to capturing the chaos, humor, and caffeine-fueled reality 
      of engineering students. From procrastination masterpieces to legendary urban myths within campus walls, 
      we document the moments that make engineering an unforgettable journey.

      Started as an inside joke among students, this blog has evolved into a collection of hilariously tragic 
      stories that every engineer can relate to. Whether you're struggling through midterms, avoiding responsibilities, 
      or just here for a laughâ€”welcome to the madness.
