      <p>In a rare and historic event, a group of engineering students was spotted outside, actually touching grass—yes, real, live grass! The occasion? A picnic that could only be described as a shocking departure from their usual habitat of dimly lit labs and code-filled screens. The students, who are more familiar with circuit boards than sunlight, figured out what to do with their freedom. But none can escape their fate for long. Within an hour, two Red Bull salespeople appeared out of nowhere, as if summoned by the scent of fresh air. They wasted no time indoctrinating the group back into the world of energy drinks, ensuring that even in nature, the engineers couldn’t escape their caffeinated destiny.</p>
