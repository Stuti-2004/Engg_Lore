      <p>In a shocking yet completely predictable turn of events, work was once again skillfully avoided as procrastination reached record highs. The geniuses who could probably build a rocket ship out of paper clips and duct tape have somehow managed to turn "I'll do it later" into an art form. Despite their superior intellect, they continue to complain about the unbearable workload they themselves ignored for days, if not weeks. It's a mystery how such brilliant minds can be so remarkably adept at creating their own crises. Truly, it's a talent—to be so smart, yet so spectacularly stupid all at once.</p>
