      <p>
        In a (not overly) surprising turn of events, a local software engineering student has redirected 
        his job hunt from tech companies to McDonald’s after over 300 unsuccessful applications. 
        “I don’t know how many people will take my ‘Meat Rotation Technician’ role seriously, but it 
        cannot be worse than putting a ‘Hello World’ project on my portfolio,” said the student, 
        wishing to remain anonymous after putting such a misleading title on his LinkedIn.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many other Software students echo similar thoughts, with another one recollecting this time as 
        <strong>“terrible and low quality”</strong>. At the end of the day, our local Software Engineer is already doing better, 
        given that he at least has a job, unlike many of his peers.

        <p>
          On this week’s edition of ‘WTF is going on’, we have a compelling reason to link 
          early onset schizophrenia with engineering. The question though is, why?
