      <p>In recent weeks, an unknown, unhinged suspect has been reportedly changing the wallpapers of student’s laptops. “If I see Norm Bartley on my screen again after I’m done pissing...” said a local Electrical Engineering student after leaving his laptop unattended for less than 20 seconds. This is the latest in a string of incidents dating back to May of this year. A local vigilante by the name of Qasim has spoken out in light of these 
        incidents, declaring the
        offender’s actions as 
        “anti-Qasim behavior,
        especially after the
        suspect’s most recent 
        work. </p>
