      <p>
        In a bizarre twist of events on August 16th, 2024, three engineering students infiltrated the Arts Building, 
        presumably in search of something called <strong>"joy"</strong>—a foreign concept to their caffeine-addled brains. 
        Shocked by the inexplicable happiness radiating from within, they launched a full-scale sabotage mission, 
        starting with a <em>Diet Coke spill</em> that left the floors as sticky as their GPA situations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not stopping there, they took to the poetry blackboard, furiously scrawling gloomy verses about the 
        <strong>futility of existence</strong> (a topic they might actually know something about). Satisfied with 
        their work, the trio scurried back to their natural habitat, safely tucked away from the daylight they so 
        desperately avoid, content in the knowledge that they had spread just a little bit of their own brand of misery.
